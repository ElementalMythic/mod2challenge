Welcome to my portfolio!

# My Work:

## Discription

For this assignment, bootcamp students were asked to make a portfolio to allow employers to see thier work and learn about them. 
This project is my first work coming with no stater code. All the code in this project was made from scratch and I am vey proud of that.
I decided to take an approach that makes my site look professional while also being unique. 
I incorporated blue and the main color so I can make the information pop out at the user. 
I also made a UI that allow for easy use including getting to view a preview of latest project. 
If you want to see more of that project, just click directly on it! 
I made a fixed navigation bar to make for easy access as I add to my page in the future. 
I would consider this page a work in progress because as I learn more skills, I can add them to my showcase!
