                        Hello!

                        My name is Ryan Gustafson. I am a student at the University of Minnesota learning how to code! I have been working hard to improve upon my coding skills. I feel that the repitition of all my practice is key to my success. My goal is to be able to to work with people who share that same passion and use my code to better the lives of others. I am known for my attention to detail and dedication to my passions. I live in the Twin Cities area with my family and spend my free time playing soccer and spending time with my loving girlfriend Lilly.
